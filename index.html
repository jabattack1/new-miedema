		There are a number of items and services I'll use when attempting to authenticate a game used jersey or cap.  A lot of different aspects are addressed in the process, so I'll offer some good sources to gain information from. <br><br>MLB ROSTERS:<br><br>I have a few go-to places for discovering who wore what number on which team when.  For MLB, my main sources are the Baseball Almanac and Baseball Reference websites, both of which feature detailed rosters of each MLB ball clubs from every year.  Of course many of these sites tend to overlook the coaches on these teams, so for that, I usually look up  the listings on Wikipedia.  Just enter the year, the team name and "roster" in your search engine and you'll have what you need in a matter of moments.<br><br>If storage space is available, preseason publications like Street & Smith's yearbooks have spring training rosters.  The more recent ones over the last 30 years are not very inclusive in featuring the uniform numbers of some of the new arrivals, but the ones I have from the 1960s and 70s feature a lot of information that would either be tough to find, or would require numerous searches to obtain.<br><br>STYLEMATCHING/PHOTOMATCHING:<br><br>Photomatching, in particular, has become the latest trend among game used collectors.  While I personally, don't venture down this road very often, I do appreciate photos for evidence of factors not as specific as a photomatch.  This is just personal preference; if a solid photomatch is what you want, by all means, go for it.<br><br>Photos can reveal a number of jersey features, some of which are listed below:<br><br>Use by a team of commemorative patches and memoriam patches/armbands.<br><br>Determining the use or lack thereof by teams of using first initials or names of players when two or more guys on the roster share the same last name.<br><br>Checking the nature of jersey NOBs (names on back).  In many cases, pro-cuts and even forgeries can be spotted, in part, by a noted difference in the placement of a NOB; closer (or further) from the back of the neck,  degree of arching of the NOB, font style of word marks, NOBs and numbers, and existence and location of sleeve TV logos that show the manufacturer's emblem.<br><br>On rare occasions, jersey tags located in the shirt tail can also be spotted.  Without magnification, most photos do not feature enough detail to read sizes, years, or NITs (name in tail). However, even a normal photo can pinpoint the location and basic display of such tags.<br><br>GETTY IMAGES<br><br>The Getty Images website shows hundreds of thousands of photos from MLB and other sports, with photos from more recent years being very plenteous, with older years featuring, in some cases, limited photos.<br><br>The one most glaring issue with Getty Images is the correct dating of the photos, specifically by years.  The dating  of photos from the last 25 years or so is pretty solid, but earlier photos are sometime spotty in terms of accuracy.  Photos, on more than a few occasions, are dated to the wrong years, with some errors being obvious (such as a 1969 photo of a player whose jersey shows the MLB 100th Anniversary patch being dated 1967 or 1970).  Others will carry dates of January 1, which is not unusual when a precise date of a game is unavailable.  While January 1 can be an actual day of game in most team sports, it's totally off for a baseball game photo.  Also, a year description of "circa 1983" also are used more than a few times, which may nail the time in the photo to a range of years but, unless a unique feature of the jersey is visible (like a commemorative patch), specifying the exact season will not usually be possible, and if it is, it'll be due to some happenstance aspect of the photo, like a uniform style or the presence of a player in the background who can be identified and research can be undertaken to see if and when the background player would have been on the same team as the player photographed, or a time frame said player would have been wearing the specific road/home uniforms he's pictured in.<br><br>Getty Images, by no means, is the only photo collection available for viewing on the web.  Wire services like the Associated Press may have great selections, as do major newspapers' sports photo links, sports-centric magazines like Sports Illustrated and ESPN the Magazine.  You can also use your Internet search engine to ask for photos of the specific player you want to research.<br><br>On occasion, even bringing up the player's list of items for auction or sale on eBay might produce good results.<br><br>In my next column, I will discuss more sites and places I go to research an item to be authenticated.  Feel free to email with questions or photos but, keep in mind, I will only issue a LOA if I see the item in hand for inspection, and there is a sliding fee scale for a full authentication of this manner.<br><br>And finally, we are now less than a month away from those beautiful words...<br><br>PITCHERS AND CATCHERS REPORT!<br><br>Dave Miedema
